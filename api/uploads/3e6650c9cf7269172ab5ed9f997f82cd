1
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,241
So?

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,841
This is the only alligator.

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,489
Four minutes past. We walk in one minute.
He was clear on that.

4
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,241
He's coming.

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,450
No, he's too young to
have that kind of access.

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,326
What time does
the restaurant open?

7
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,563
Noon. But the food's a little too spicy.

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,041
This way.

9
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,130
Excuse me.

10
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,481
Thank you.

11
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,201
Right here.

12
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,283
It's really great to
finally meet you guys.

13
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,086
So, first thing, can I get
your cell phones, please?

14
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,601
Thank you.

15
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,886
We want Laura to be the
only one recording, right?

16
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,689
As discussed?

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,731
I actually bought this.
It blocks UHF frequencies.

18
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,130
You've been photographed before, right?

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,883
Yeah, it's been a while since
anybody took a photo of me, so...

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,849
Try thinking of this as your friend.

21
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400
Take your time.

22
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,202
Can you start by telling us
why you did what you did

23
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,362
and, how you gained access

24
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,010
to such a vast amount of information,

25
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,685
all of which I read on the plane

26
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,689
- and...
- Glenn.

27
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,483
How about we just start with your name?

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,842
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden.

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,401
I'm 29 years old.

30
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,041
I work as a private
contractor for the NSA.

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,043
I've also worked as
a private contractor

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,649
for the CIA and directly for the Agency.

33
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,121
I've worked in various jobs
in the intelligence industry

34
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,884
for the last nine years.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,211
I've been a systems engineer,
been a solutions consultant...

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,086
And a senior advisor for
the Central Intelligence Agency.

37
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,330
Rangers...

38
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,446
So you wanna be Special Forces?

39
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,646
I think Special Forces would be ashamed

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,961
to call you soldiers.
Am I right?

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,246
Sir, no, sir!

42
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,530
Your left, right.

43
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,888
Went from driving Cadillacs

44
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,446
To driving convoys in Iraq

45
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,686
Move it, soldier!

46
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,243
Move now!

47
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,410
Move!
You better get going!

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,204
Pick it up, you waste of space!

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,966
Let's move!

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,770
Come on, soldier! Go!

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,324
What are you doing?

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,487
Nothing, sir!

53
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,403
- Where is your heart?
- Right here, sir!

54
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,960
I want you to reach way down in
that pathetic excuse of a chest,

55
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,326
and you rip it out.

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,084
You find your heart,
and then you get

57
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,964
your broke ass on my tower!
You got that?

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,007
Sir, yes, sir!

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,610
Now get out of my face!

60
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,324
I need you on my tower,
gentlemen! Let's move!

61
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,609
Move! Let's go!

62
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,690
Rise and shine, maggots!

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,122
Get your hands off your dicks, and
get out of my barracks!

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,531
You guys got one minute!

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,807
Fall out! Move!

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,365
Get the hell out here! Get
the hell out of my barracks!

67
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,051
Move it!
Keep moving!

68
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,441
Let's go!
All right, gentlemen.

69
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,241
- Harrison?
- Here!

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,441
- Carson?
- Here!

71
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,567
- Ramirez?
- Here!

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,761
- Pierce?
- Here!

73
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,526
Help!

74
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,803
Where is Snowden?

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,644
Help!

76
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,604
You know, you've been walking
around on two broken legs...

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,808
Best I can tell, for weeks.

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,245
Now this is what happens when
you put a 80-pound rucksack

79
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,560
on a 150-pound body.

80
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,927
You get these little stress
fractures and...

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,287
- Easy.
- Sorry.

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
They build up in your tibias.

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,763
You don't get off of 'em,
and eventually they just bust.

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
Now, you're gonna be
here for a few weeks,

85
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,929
and then I'd count on
another eight weeks or so

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,206
on the crutches.

87
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,044
Okay, and then when do I go back?

88
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,283
Son, you ever again
land on those legs of yours,

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,762
airborne or not, those
bones will turn to powder.

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm gonna authorize
an administrative discharge.

91
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,841
Plenty of other ways
to serve your country.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,762
Have you ever committed a crime
for which you weren't caught?

93
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,447
No.

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,927
Have you ever cheated on an exam?

95
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,641
No.

96
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,765
Do you believe the United States

97
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,291
is the greatest country in the world?

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,846
Yes.

99
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,569
Why do you want to join the CIA?

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,401
How would you explain
the Internet to a child?

101
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,006
Granddad retired as an
admiral and joined the FBI.

102
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,686
Dad's in the Coast Guard, 30-year man.

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,604
What has been the most
important day in your life?

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,205
9/11.

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,931
We thought my grandfather
was inside the Pentagon.

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,885
Turned out he was off-site that day.

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,520
You wanted to be Special Forces?

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,924
<i>Yeah, I love their motto.
De oppresso liber.</i>

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,767
Is that what you hope to do with
us? Free people from oppression?

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,286
I'd like to help my country
make a difference in the world.

111
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,326
The Internet is a technology

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,730
that has the power

113
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,327
to let everyone in the
world understand each other.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,883
Missed a perfect score on the
ASVAB test by a single question.

115
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,726
Crushed the language learning test.

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,406
Some Mandarin, some Japanese.

117
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,843
And no high school diploma.

118
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,883
So why did you stop
attending high school?

119
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,411
I had to make money. My parents
were divorcing at the time.

120
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,930
Any other influences?

121
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,801
I'd say Joseph Campbell,

122
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,247
Star Wars, Thoreau, Ayn Rand...

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,649
One man can stop the motor of the world.

124
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,166
Atlas Shrugged.
Yes, sir. I believe that.

125
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,641
Let's try again.

126
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,161
Why do you want to join the CIA?

127
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,570
Well, frankly, sir,

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,529
it sounds really cool to
have top security clearance.

129
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,364
It's not enough.

130
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,561
Ordinarily. But these
are not ordinary times.

131
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,488
Bombs won't stop terrorism, brains will,

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,682
and we don't have
nearly enough of those.

133
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,122
I'm gonna give you a shot, Snowden.

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,604
Thank you very much.
You won't regret this.

135
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,049
My name's Corbin O'Brian.

136
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,691
I have many titles, among
them Senior Instructor.

137
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,882
You'll be joining my class at The Hill.

138
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,010
Stop the vehicle.

139
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,206
Shut off the engine.

140
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,131
I need to see your ID.

141
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,167
All right. Using your left
hand only, pop the trunk.

142
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,807
Now place your hands

143
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,769
through the steering wheel
on the dashboard.

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,565
Through the steering wheel.

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,646
On the dashboard.
Do not exit the vehicle.

146
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,321
Right here.

147
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,685
Excuse me.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,604
You'll be looking for Corbin's class.

149
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,365
End of the hall, keep going
through the second set of doors.

150
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,922
Is that an Enigma?

151
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,920
No. Enigma was broken.

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,810
This is the follow up,
the Sigaba. Never broken.

153
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,080
Cold War's greatest encryption machine.

154
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,484
Tides of history ticked with
this motor and these rotors.

155
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,444
One day everyone's gonna
want a machine like this.

156
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,329
I always wanted to learn cryptography.
What's this one?

157
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,769
The Hot Line.

158
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,605
First direct link between
Washington and Moscow.

159
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,728
Probably prevented World War III.

160
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,881
You got a name? How do I
know you're not the enemy?

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,849
Sorry. Ed Snowden.

162
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,810
Hank Forrester. Where'd
you study, Snowden?

163
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,848
Mostly I'm self-taught.

164
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,846
You can tell me if you're
busy, but is that a Cray-1?

165
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,800
Yes, it is.

166
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,410
The first supercomputer.

167
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,164
You can get all of this
on a cell phone now.

168
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,965
So you're an engineer?

169
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,842
Am I an engineer?
Instructor and counselor, too.

170
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,161
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you CTs,

171
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,322
make sure you don't
buckle under the pressure.

172
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,686
Turn to drugs and booze.

173
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,807
Well, you won't have that problem
with me. I don't drink or do drugs.

174
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,530
What is your sin of choice?

175
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,523
Computers.

176
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,761
Well, then, Snowden, you've come
to the right little whorehouse.

177
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,524
The front lines in the
global war on terror

178
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,523
are not in Iraq or Afghanistan.

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,002
They're here. In London,

180
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,480
Berlin,

181
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,766
Istanbul...

182
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,681
Any server, any connection...

183
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,726
The modern battlefield

184
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,606
is everywhere.

185
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,005
Which means

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,810
you don't have to sit in the ditch
eating MREs or dodging mortar fire,

187
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,683
it means that if there is
another 9/11, it'll be your fault.

188
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,411
Just as the last one
was my generation's.

189
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,730
Believe me, you do not want
to live with that burden.

190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,247
We're gonna start with an aptitude test.

191
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,843
Each of you is gonna build a
covert communications network

192
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,410
in your home city,

193
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,170
you're gonna deploy it,
back up your site, destroy it,

194
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,924
and restore it again.

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,809
The point of this exercise is to keep

196
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,486
your infrastructure up
and running securely.

197
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,771
The average test time is five hours.

198
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,130
If you take more than
eight, you will fail.

199
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,211
Mr. O'Brian?

200
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,971
I'm done, sir.

201
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,851
You don't have to tell me
when you've completed a stage.

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,809
No, I finished the whole thing.

203
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,170
It's been 40 minutes.

204
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,526
Thirty-eight.

205
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,806
What?

206
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,811
Thirty-eight minutes.

207
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,727
Okay. Let's see where you screwed up.

208
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,771
You didn't say we had
to do it in order, sir.

209
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,923
Sol, broke the sequence to save time,

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,085
and I automated the backup
process to run as I built the site.

211
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,046
Eyes on screens.

212
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,484
What should I do now?

213
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,925
Whatever you want.

214
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,209
Finally.

215
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,481
Sorry.

216
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,244
Do you want anything?

217
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,051
No. Let's go for a walk.

218
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,804
You could use some sun.

219
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,086
You mentioned that earlier.

220
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,481
Sorry it took me this long.

221
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,771
You didn't want to see me on crutches.
I was not so agile.

222
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,724
And then this new job hit. So...

223
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,246
what was it you were doing again?

224
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,243
I'm doing analysis for
the State Department.

225
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,368
Right. Congratulations.

226
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,885
You're welcome.

227
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,689
Can you do me a favor

228
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,001
and point in the direction
of the State Department?

229
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,605
Yeah, it's that way.

230
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,401
Where? Are you sure?

231
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,285
I mean, I'm not that great
at orienting myself...

232
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,601
Not that great at lying, either.

233
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,286
You're gonna have to work on
both if you wanna be a spy.

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,490
Where I came from, everyone's parents

235
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,642
worked for the "State Department."

236
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,690
Plus, every time you
visited my website this week,

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,526
which was quite often,
it was from an IP in Virginia.

238
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,768
- You know how to run an IP trace?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,081
I'm pretty sure that the State
Department has no offices in Virginia.

240
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,885
All right, let's see you strut it.

241
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,526
Let's see what?

242
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,170
Let's see you strut it. Show
me what you got, you know.

243
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,924
Your best catwalk.

244
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,447
Don't be shy.

245
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,807
You got this.

246
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,646
I don't know.

247
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,210
Drop Bush, not bombs!

248
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,362
Excuse me. Would you mind
signing our petition, please?

249
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,771
Yes, absolutely.

250
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,769
Thank you so much.

251
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,921
No, thank you.

252
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,170
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like to sign?

253
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,924
- I actually just signed.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,528
Too much independent spirit for you?

255
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,841
No, I just don't really
like bashing my country.

256
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,726
It's my country too, and right
now it has blood on its hands.

257
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,124
Sorry, I have friends who
are over there right now.

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,561
I'm not talking about the troops.

259
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,483
I'm talking about the moron
sending them to war.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,404
You mean our
Commander-in-Chief?

261
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,881
Yeah, whatever you want to
call him. He's still wrong.

262
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,689
How do you know he's wrong?
You're just lashing out.

263
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,560
No, I'm not lashing out. I'm
questioning our government.

264
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,766
That's what we do in this country.

265
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,207
That is the principle
that we were founded on.

266
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,444
Okay, but how about
questioning the liberal media?

267
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,611
I mean, you're just buying
into what one side is saying.

268
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,051
Maybe I am, 'cause my side is right.

269
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,728
- See, that's funny, 'cause my side's right.
- Really?

270
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,087
Yeah.

271
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,202
Why is it smart conservatives
always make me so mad?

272
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,601
Probably because you don't
like hearing the truth.

273
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,046
You are a very frustrating
individual, you know that?

274
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,962
How am I going to make you see?

275
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,281
I can see just fine,
thank you.

276
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,160
That help at all?

277
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,046
No, that did nothing for me.

278
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
Tastes like liberal.

279
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,284
It's not my thing.

280
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,126
Is it constitutional
to bypass the Courts?

281
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,806
No. The Fourth Amendment
prevents searches

282
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,325
and seizures
without a warrant.

283
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,927
That's absolutely right,
Rio. Which means

284
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,570
your Commander-in-Chief, the
President of the United States,

285
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,483
is breaking the law.

286
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,489
That is what you're
saying, isn't it, Rio?

287
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,521
Well, I guess it depends
on who you talk to.

288
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,443
And if you talk to journalists?

289
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Who, more often than not,
don't have the full picture,

290
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,487
or neglect to report it,
you only get a partial truth.

291
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,925
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,525
The FISA Court.

293
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,284
We do respect the Fourth
Amendment in this country,

294
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,925
and we issue warrants
based on suspicion.

295
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,370
But sometimes these warrants have
to be issued by secret courts,

296
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,091
so we don't alert
the suspects we're spying on.

297
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,363
And these court proceedings
are classified,

298
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,204
which means, surprise...

299
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,450
They don't appear in papers
such as The New York Times.

300
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,166
Did you see my test scores?

301
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,523
Yes. Top of my class.
Like you. What, here?

302
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,683
NSA. They liked me plenty.

303
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,049
They put me on all the best teams.
Soviet frontier. Desert Storm.

304
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,562
And then the big new challenge,

305
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,168
find the terrorist in the Internet
haystack. Hell of a haystack.

306
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,685
Hundreds of
terabytes a minute.

307
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,684
I mean, it would take you 400
years to read the emails.

308
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
Then you have
to analyze them.

309
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,841
Sometimes, the more you
look, the less you see.

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,763
- What'd you come up with?
- Something beautiful.

311
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,241
In house.
For $3 million.

312
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,405
A program that could differentiate
between foreign and domestic,

313
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,121
encrypt every signal we weren't
targeting, so it would remain private.

314
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,442
It was elegant, streamlined.

315
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,363
It was the best
work I ever did.

316
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,081
Have a seat.

317
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,960
What was it called?

318
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,131
Ed, rising to the top in our world

319
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,568
can sometimes be hard on a man.

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,009
You think you're making strides,

321
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,771
you think you're taking the initiative.

322
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,490
And then, the next minute, they
grind your work out of existence.

323
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,042
- They didn't use it?
- Why not?

324
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,521
Well, they never tell you why.

325
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,646
Two years later, after 9/11,

326
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,046
a friend of mine tells me about

327
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,930
this new contractor
program they're using.

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,446
Costs $4 billion to deploy.

329
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,481
Modeled after mine but with
no filters, no automation.

330
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,201
Ingested everything.
They were drowning in data.

331
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,930
It was a disaster.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,890
Okay, but there must have been
some bigger picture, right?

333
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,282
I mean, spending that kind of money?
They're not stupid.

334
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,011
You would think intelligence
would count for something

335
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,963
in the intelligence business.

336
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,448
Right. But you wanna
know what it really is?

337
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,727
What really sets the agenda?

338
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,123
Military industrial
happiness management.

339
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,042
You keep the coffers open in Congress,

340
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,283
you keep the money flowing
to the contractors.

341
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,081
Efficiency, results?
They go out the window.

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,126
Well, you're late
for class.

343
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,801
- Can I take another one?
- Sure.

344
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,411
Did you ever say anything to anybody?

345
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,610
Yeah. I went to legal.
We filed complaints.

346
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,526
Now here I am,
tucked away, teaching you.

347
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,766
Maybe that's more important,
in the long run.

348
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,687
You're getting better.

349
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,528
My favorite spot on campus.

350
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,610
You hunt, Ed?

351
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,491
Did some skeet shooting
with my dad a few times,

352
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,324
but, no, I never went hunting.

353
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,606
We'll go one day.

354
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,920
That'd be great.

355
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,964
Mr. O'Brian, can I ask you a question?

356
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,804
How about just calling me Corbin?

357
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,721
Thank you, sir. Corbin.

358
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,208
I was talking with Hank
Forrester and I wanted to know,

359
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,171
are all of our SIGINT
programs specifically targeted?

360
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,720
Of course. What good would
they be if they weren't?

361
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,571
Yeah, I don't know.

362
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,683
You have a girlfriend, Ed?

363
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,530
Nothing serious.

364
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,045
- What's her name?
- Lindsay.

365
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,167
Lindsay.

366
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,010
She going with you?

367
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,644
No, I wouldn't want
to put her in any danger.

368
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,801
Well, you won't have to.

369
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,288
We're not sending you
to the Middle East.

370
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,128
Sir, I'm your best student.
Doesn't that count for something?

371
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,409
In 20 years, Iraq will be a
hellhole nobody cares about.

372
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,528
Terrorism's a short-term threat.

373
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,128
The real threats will come
from China, Russia, Iran,

374
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,050
and they'll come as SQL
injections and malware.

375
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,245
Without minds like yours, this country
will be torn apart in cyberspace.

376
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,485
I don't want to risk losing you

377
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,331
for some horseshit
war over sand and oil.

378
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,849
Sir, I'm surprised to hear you say that.

379
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,288
You don't have to agree with
your politicians to be a patriot.

380
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,800
- Sir, where are you sending me?
- Take a moment.

381
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,851
Enjoy the view.

382
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,846
This is Laura.

383
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,050
Hello, nice to meet you.

384
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,009
Hello, I'm Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian.
It's nice to meet you.

385
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,286
Nice to meet you, too.

386
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,887
If you don't mind,
I'd like to record some of...

387
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,327
Cell phones go in the microwave.

388
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,801
Dare I ask why?

389
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,326
We'll get to that.
After you ask your questions.

390
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,642
Before we get on to the stories,
I need to know more about you.

391
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,123
Your career by Glenn's
account is very varied,

392
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,884
but the Guardian needs evidence that...

393
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,009
Yeah. This is my diplomatic
passport for friendly countries,

394
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,969
my tourist passport for everywhere else.

395
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,451
You can check the visa stamps.

396
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,570
This is my NSA badge with Booz
Allen, my CIA badge with Dell,

397
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,723
and this is my DIA instructor's badge.

398
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,724
This is a photo of me
with Michael Hayden,

399
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,724
who's a former head
of the NSA and the CIA.

400
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,166
When can you publish?

401
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,643
- Okay, do you mind if I sit down?
- No, please.

402
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,209
Glenn says you want to...

403
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,249
You want to tell people your identity.

404
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,924
How do you think your
government's going to react?

405
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,601
Well, they'll charge me
under the Espionage Act.

406
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,411
And they'll say I
endangered national security,

407
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,165
and they'll demonize me,
and my friends and family.

408
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,011
And they'll throw me in jail.

409
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,128
That's the best-case scenario.

410
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,526
And the worst?

411
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,807
Well, if I don't have any media cover,

412
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,486
then I'll be rendered by the CIA

413
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,927
and interrogated outside of the law.

414
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,651
And they have a station
right up the street.

415
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,121
But how would they know what you did?

416
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,761
Because I left a digital footprint in
my logs, so they'll figure it out.

417
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,808
I did not want
a manhunt.

418
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,042
I know what they would
do to my colleagues.

419
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,164
Look, Mr. MacAskill,

420
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,847
this is not about money
or anything for me.

421
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
There's no hidden agenda.

422
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,040
I just wanted to get this data to
established journalists like yourselves,

423
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,361
so that you can present it
to the world,

424
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,967
and the people can decide
either I'm wrong

425
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,885
or there's something going on inside
the government that's really wrong.

426
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,727
So...

427
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,011
This one is everything I have

428
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,004
on your British intelligence
agency, the GCHQ.

429
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,048
An encryption key will follow.

430
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,726
You're gonna want your
technical people at the Guardian

431
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,006
to look through that thoroughly.

432
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,003
There's a lot of stuff there.

433
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,525
Listen, they're gonna investigate,

434
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,610
and they're gonna figure
out what I've done.

435
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,803
And then they're gonna come for me.

436
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,450
And now that we've made contact,

437
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,009
they're gonna come for all of you, too.

438
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,930
Do you mind if I go
look in the microwave?

439
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,249
Ewen. I'm on with Stuart.

440
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,328
Stuart. Look, I've got one thing to say.

441
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,921
- The Guinness here is great.
- Wonderful...

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,128
Absolutely the genuine article.

443
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,326
Good.

444
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,846
But shockingly different
from what you'd expect.

445
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,645
Now we have the lawyers to deal
with. And no doubt the White House.

446
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,441
I got the go ahead.

447
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,806
That's great.

448
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,644
Let's get started. We have
a lot to go through here,

449
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,051
and it's not easy reading.

450
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,929
We can start by showing him XKeyscore.

451
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,321
Good idea. Ed, can you bring it
up again and walk us through it?

452
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,481
Yeah.

453
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,243
Do we all get under there now?

454
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,601
He's protecting his passwords.

455
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,887
Okay. So...

456
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,931
This was introduced

457
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,528
during my first deployment
at the CIA in Geneva.

458
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,726
"XKeyscore."

459
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,611
What does that do?

460
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,764
It's like a search interface.

461
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,084
What does it search for?

462
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,964
Anything you want.

463
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,009
What was your assignment in Geneva?

464
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,281
Well, I was assigned with
diplomatic cover to the UN mission

465
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,931
to maintain the CIA's
computer security network.

466
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,205
I spent almost two years
around CIA field officers.

467
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,001
I don't see a time stamp on any of this.

468
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,650
We have a confirmation on the GSS.

469
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,686
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

470
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,331
Sherman says you hacked
the Human Resources site.

471
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,249
Yeah, it's my job to find flaws.

472
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,006
The security of the HR
site is not your problem.

473
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,650
You went outside the wheelhouse.

474
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,166
Okay, but just to clarify,
I did not hack it,

475
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,721
I showed that it could be hacked.

476
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,126
You told me to find a patch.

477
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,361
You have that in writing?

478
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,649
Yes, I do. Remember, I sent
you the proof of concept.

479
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,006
Doesn't matter
what you did, Snowden.

480
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,686
Right or wrong, you need to let these
things be someone else's problem.

481
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,604
He's also put
a derog in your file.

482
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,091
Excuse me?
Let that be a lesson.

483
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,525
I don't want him
calling me again

484
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,329
about another
Ed Snowden moment.

485
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,811
Okay?

486
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,844
Why don't you take it easy
the rest of the day?

487
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,763
Go work on
the scrubbing pile.

488
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,364
That didn't look
like it went well.

489
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,731
Oh, hey, man. Uh, yeah. No, I just
got a derog for doing my job.

490
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,401
Politics, man. The
culture of fear wins again.

491
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,887
I can't get anything done here.
Yeah.

492
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,961
What about that idea
that we were talking about?

493
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,644
I'm working on it.
I'm waiting for a call back

494
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,210
from our friend
at The Hill.

495
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,004
Who, Corbin? You called Corbin?

496
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,445
You think he can
do something?

497
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,524
We'll see. Maybe some limited
field ops under my supervision.

498
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,125
Yes, that would be amazing.
I would love...

499
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,966
Easy, Ed. I've gotta see a cleric in Milan.
We'll talk after.

500
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,801
CIA does not like
to leave a trace, huh?

501
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,881
Can I help you?

502
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,689
You get curious
to check one out?

503
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,288
See what kind of crazy-ass
covert kill mission

504
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,441
you might be erasing
from history?

505
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,641
I'm sorry,
who are you with?

506
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,446
No Such Agency.
I'm Gabriel Sol.

507
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,848
I'm the 50-pound brain from the
Council of Wizards and Warlocks.

508
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,641
Excuse me?

509
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,927
Giving you your Intel
for Bucharest, dude.

510
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,923
Unless there's
another Dave Churchyard.

511
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,651
No. That's me.
Right this way.

512
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,281
I'll be right outside.
Stay if you want.

513
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,888
I don't have
authorization to use NSA programs.

514
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,041
Well, if you're
the messenger to Bucharest,

515
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,531
you must have
a PRIVAC clearance

516
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,250
to see the finished
Intel, yes?

517
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,281
Yeah, so what
difference does it make

518
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,600
if you see how
it's put together?

519
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,810
Well, it's up to you, man.

520
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,328
You're giving me
just names?

521
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,965
And a lot more
than names.

522
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,449
What I will be providing you and the
fine gentlemen of the Secret Service

523
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,401
is a list of every threat made about
the President since February 3rd.

524
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,960
And a profile of
every threat-maker.

525
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,885
And these are, like,
existing targets?

526
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,163
99% are gonna come from the
bulk collection program, so...

527
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,129
Upstream, Muscular,
Tempora, PRISM.

528
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,001
PRISM?

529
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,843
You got a little
Snow White in you.

530
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,203
Which makes me feel like the witch
bringing you a poisoned apple.

531
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,601
Here. Exhibit A.

532
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,889
Oakland resident Justin Pinsky
posted on a message board,

533
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,725
"Romania has a storied history
of executing their leaders,

534
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,644
"couldn't they do us a solid
and take out Bush?"

535
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,525
Now this looks juicy.
This is from a G-chat.

536
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,842
"With the biggest python
you've ever seen."

537
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,363
How is this all possible?

538
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,442
Keyword selectors.

539
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,682
"Attack," "take out Bush."

540
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,050
So think of it as
a Google search,

541
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,088
except instead of searching
only what people make public,

542
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,367
we're also looking at
everything they don't. So...

543
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,769
Emails, chats,
SMS, whatever.

544
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,524
Yeah, but which people?

545
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,564
The whole kingdom,
Snow White.

546
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,484
Which ambassador
was he again?

547
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,131
De La Hoya, with
World Trade Organization.

548
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,326
Right.

549
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,604
O'Brian came through
for you.

550
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,401
He agrees your talents are being wasted.
You ready for a little action?

551
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,771
Really? What,
you mean right here?

552
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,163
Yeah. Now.

553
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,322
See the woman in
the pink number?

554
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,167
Credit Suisse. J.P. Morgan's on her arm.
Grandma's with Deutsche Bank.

555
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,083
Ten thousand bankers
in this town.

556
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,083
All you need to turn is one.

557
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,284
Socialize. Meet a few.

558
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,091
Preferably ones sitting on
a pile of dirty Saudi money

559
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,571
that's funding bin Laden.

560
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,923
Thank you very much. Church.
Church. Sure. Churchyard.

561
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,531
Mr. Debrinin asks
your business card, please.

562
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,281
An ambassador.

563
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,369
I wish I had your
schmoozing skills.

564
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,283
Well,
that's why you have me.

565
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,131
Yeah. You don't know any
bankers, do you? Bankers?

566
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,440
Are you on some kind of
assignment or something?

567
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,249
"Relationship cultivating."
And not well.

568
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,046
Let me help you.

569
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,246
No.
Yeah.

570
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,841
No, this is serious.
I know it's serious.

571
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,161
Trust me.

572
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,486
Any luck?

573
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,006
No bites.

574
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,841
Is there some kind
of trick to it?

575
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,801
It's all about finding
the pressure point.

576
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,968
Everything else is
just pushing on it.

577
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,170
Looks like
you're being summoned.

578
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,691
- We have to pay extra...
- Marwan? May I interrupt?

579
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,921
This is my boyfriend, Dave.

580
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,526
Hello, Dave. Nice to meet you.

581
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,681
Marwan works at Monfort.

582
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,240
We were talking,
and after last week,

583
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,129
he may be able
to give you some tips.

584
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,771
Gentlemen, I'll see you inside.
Last week?

585
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,683
He's embarrassed. It was
a lot of money for us.

586
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,241
Day trading is a perilous sport.

587
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,727
You shouldn't be ashamed of it.

588
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,125
I'm gonna grab some food.
See you guys inside?

589
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,326
Sure.

590
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
You have a lovely girlfriend.
Thank you so much.

591
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,568
You know, I work in IT,
and so I just figured

592
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,405
I could crack the market
like a weak network.

593
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,603
May I ask, how precipitous
were your losses?

594
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,491
Well, I told Lindsay
it was 20,000,

595
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,404
but between you and me,
it was closer to 45.

596
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,647
Tried to recoup,
but that was a mistake,

597
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,324
and now without
any real grounding,

598
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,970
I feel like I'm just
sliding out of control.

599
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,929
I have seen it
many times.

600
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,809
And I'm always happy
to help a man

601
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,167
break a bad habit
before it gets going.

602
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,083
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

603
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,165
This is the cleanest
Pakistani I've ever seen.

604
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,402
We got no first-degree ties
to government or ISI,

605
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,925
no shady family.

606
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,650
I mean, second-degree contacts
are off the charts,

607
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,330
but that's everyone in the Middle East

608
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,686
with a six-figure income.

609
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,526
Well, it's not dirt that we need
necessarily, it's a pressure point.

610
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,769
Something intimate,
some kind of weakness.

611
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,123
Can we look through his family?

612
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,606
How about
his sister-in-law?

613
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,927
Yeah.

614
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,808
What is that, is that some
video that she sent somebody?

615
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,281
No, this is live.
Out of Paris.

616
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,766
What do you mean, live?

617
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,570
Optic Nerve. It's
camera and mic activation.

618
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,722
I wish we could take credit,
but the Brits wrote it.

619
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,165
Activation?

620
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,163
Yeah, her laptop's off.

621
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,890
Or was, she just forgot to close it.

622
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,007
Of course,
how would she know?

623
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,606
This shit is so sly, the webcam
light doesn't even turn on.

624
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,209
I always wondered
what was under those.

625
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,206
Okay, look, let's stick
to family in Geneva.

626
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,726
All right?

627
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,802
Okay, Snow White.

628
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,325
Fifteen-year-old daughter
at the International School.

629
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,724
Yeah. Facebook?
Is that possible?

630
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,484
Facebook's my bitch.

631
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,050
Seriously?

632
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,483
Like, she fights
with her parents, or...

633
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,882
Don't worry, don't worry. I know all
the hooks for this kind of fishing.

634
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,326
Query name. So email, keyword,
whatever selector you want.

635
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,163
And justification
is where I write...

636
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,569
In other words, turning your
daddy into a CIA informant.

637
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,808
Wait, that's it? That's it, bro.

638
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,490
You don't have to get
a FISA court order?

639
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,446
No, not here.
XKeyscore's under 702 authority,

640
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,363
which means no warrants.

641
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,127
Okay, but U.S. targets then, you'd
have to get the court order?

642
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,727
You mean FISA? Yeah, they're just
a big-ass rubber stamp, dude.

643
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,484
I mean, FISA judges
are all appointed by

644
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,166
the Chief Justice,
who's like, you know...

645
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,245
Darth Vader when it comes
to national security. Boom.

646
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,205
Here we go.

647
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,690
And the boy at third base is...

648
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,046
Nadim. Okay. He's 18.

649
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,441
Salma says she wants
to marry him,

650
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,329
but is scared of
telling her parents.

651
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,725
What she doesn't know is that
his other name is Nicolas.

652
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,567
And he's currently banging
Geraldine and Julie.

653
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,602
He and his Turkish mother
are here illegally.

654
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,967
That's it.

655
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,528
You like that?

656
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,125
I love these.

657
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,925
What are
we doing here?

658
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,807
You're making people
very happy.

659
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,406
Mr. Marwan's bank
handles serious Saudi money,

660
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,767
and a whole bunch of
Russian billionaires.

661
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,084
What about any Al-Qaeda money?
Anything promising?

662
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,681
Ed, I'm up for
a promotion soon.

663
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,643
I will not forget
my friends.

664
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,771
Thank you.

665
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,370
This is all going kind of
fast though, right?

666
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,363
I mean, I just sent
some initial background.

667
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,602
There he is!

668
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,920
Marwan!

669
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,163
Dave. How wonderful
to see you.

670
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,526
Good to see you, too.

671
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,441
I was counting, Marwan, you snuck
in an extra half hour back there.

672
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,366
I'm afraid she was merely
listening to an old man's woes.

673
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,441
I see.

674
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,363
So, how are you,
Marwan?

675
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,047
I must tell you,
Dave, since we met,

676
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,009
my life has gone
somewhat Topsy-turvy.

677
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,163
I'm sorry to hear that.

678
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,244
But your colleague
Charles here

679
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,527
has graciously
offered his help.

680
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,921
So I owe him and you
a great deal.

681
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,729
Can I ask
what happened?

682
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,926
My daughter had an...

683
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,970
Marwan's daughter
took too many sleeping pills.

684
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,644
She's all right.

685
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,644
It had something to do with her
boyfriend, who was recently deported.

686
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,643
We're trying to secure
a visa for him.

687
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,202
And even so,
I'm afraid that Salma will...

688
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,601
I'm sorry. I won't trouble
you with such matters.

689
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,526
You talk as much as you want.

690
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,285
All right?
Family comes first.

691
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,246
There's my beauty.

692
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,164
I'm never
like this before.

693
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,083
Sure.
No, of course.

694
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,322
You sit down, huh?
Sit tight.

695
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,884
You sit tight.

696
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,485
What is going on?

697
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,528
I have been acting
swiftly and effectively

698
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,649
on the very good signals
intelligence you've provided.

699
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,167
And if his daughter
had died?

700
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,004
We could have
used that too.

701
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,162
Are you serious? What, in
the name of a promotion?

702
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,687
Marwan can't be away
from his family right now.

703
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,007
So in the morning, when
he's facing a week in jail,

704
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,163
we're going to offer him a deal
and he won't turn it down.

705
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,401
Wait, jail? For what?

706
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,561
Drunk driving.

707
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,007
Now, I want you
to call the police.

708
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,320
Tell 'em you saw
a Mercedes headed north...

709
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,640
No, he's not driving
right now.

710
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,529
Look at him,
he'll kill himself.

711
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,443
Okay. I'll call 'em.

712
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,081
He's not driving.

713
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,920
Remind me, are you authorized on
any of the NSA programs you used?

714
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,248
So we're both doing a little
fucked up shit here, huh?

715
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,087
Watch yourself, Ed. I will
tell him who you are.

716
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,365
You reveal the identity
of an undercover officer,

717
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,125
you're going to jail
for a lot longer than Marwan.

718
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,171
Sorry I'm so late.

719
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,291
How was work?

720
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,161
It was all right.

721
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,803
I have to
wake up in, like, three hours.

722
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,325
My flight's at 7:00.

723
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,648
Well, we'd better
be quick, then.

724
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,848
I will provide our intelligence
and law enforcement agencies

725
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,730
with the tools they need to track
and take out the terrorists

726
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,810
without undermining our
constitution and our freedom.

727
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,484
That means no
more illegal wiretapping

728
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,800
of American citizens.

729
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,168
No more ignoring the law
when it is inconvenient.

730
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,651
That is not who we are.

731
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,530
What happened
to the London trip?

732
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,405
Turns out I'm not going.

733
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,043
What's going on?
Who's winning?

734
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,202
And Michelle Obama
voted this morning in Chicago.

735
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,725
- I voted.
- In Arizona...

736
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,046
Still early.

737
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,248
John and Cindy McCain voted,
and then they landed in Colorado

738
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,169
to defend a traditionally
Republican state

739
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,685
that has turned
into a battleground.

740
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,761
Let's see.

741
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,409
Obama ahead 67%
to 32%...

742
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,609
Come on, big ears.
Check out Florida.

743
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,888
He's gonna win it!

744
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,362
- What, Florida?
- Yeah!

745
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,442
- That's big. Yeah.
- It's huge!

746
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,522
You can act all nonchalant, but I know
you were starting to root for him.

747
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,323
I've been watching
your inner liberal grow.

748
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,562
For which I will take a modest
percentage of the credit.

749
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,688
And you deserve it.

750
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,287
What is this?

751
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,600
In Missouri.

752
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,366
56% for McCain,
43% for Obama.

753
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,962
Yeah, that. Leave that there.

754
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,051
Russian hackers.
The Agency says

755
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,691
they can activate
webcams now. So...

756
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,761
That's creepy.

757
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,081
Yes. It's really
bothering me.

758
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,721
Whatever. It's not a big deal.
You shouldn't let it bother you.

759
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,569
It's not a big deal? No.

760
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,007
What, that someone could
be watching you right now?

761
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,285
No, I'm not
hiding anything.

762
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,007
That's such
a bullshit line. What is?

763
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,521
I have nothing to hide. I don't.

764
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,806
Everyone does.

765
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,881
Okay, well then,
what do I have to hide?

766
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,722
Forget it. No,
what do I have to hide?

767
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,643
No, never...
Let's just drop it.

768
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,042
Well, apparently you think that I'm
hiding something, so...

769
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,566
Okay, the other day,
your computer was open,

770
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,450
and I happened to notice you
were on the site where we met,

771
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,760
and you were looking
at other guys.

772
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,002
You just were looking
at my computer?

773
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,171
I wouldn't have
even brought this up.

774
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,242
You asked me,
"What do I have to hide?"

775
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,322
That's something
you're not telling me.

776
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,762
Well, I don't do anything,

777
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,087
I don't meet any
of those people.

778
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,810
You're gone for weeks
at a time.

779
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,366
So it's like I'm peering
into other peoples' lives

780
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,482
because my own is
just temporarily on hold.

781
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,051
That sounds like
an excuse.

782
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,366
It's the truth.

783
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,367
I should have told you.
And I didn't.

784
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,081
I'm really sorry.
But it's not a big deal.

785
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,641
Look at me.
I don't want anyone else.

786
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,164
I don't want
any other life.

787
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,522
I didn't go to London today
'cause I resigned.

788
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,761
What?

789
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,003
It was personal differences,

790
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,162
and it was a matter
of principle.

791
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,884
Can you tell me
anything else?

792
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,931
Do you get
reposted, or...

793
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,651
No, I resigned
from the CIA.

794
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,162
So what does
that mean? What do we do?

795
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,682
I don't know. I'll figure
it out, but listen, I...

796
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,608
This is a good thing.
Trust me.

797
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,486
I do.

798
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,441
He's gonna win.

799
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,610
52% for Obama,
48% for McCain.

800
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,886
Yeah, he'd better.

801
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,085
CNN can now project that
Barack Obama, 47 years old,

802
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,891
will become the President of the
United States-

803
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,962
Every agency and department
should know that this administration

804
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,326
stands on the side

805
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,528
not of those who seek
to withhold information,

806
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,443
but those who seek
to make it known.

807
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,963
Janine is
the website editor

808
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,010
of a small stateside office
of a British newspaper,

809
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,606
up against the most powerful
government in the world.

810
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,966
She won't be bullied.

811
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,408
We need to establish
that we're not compromising

812
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,323
national security
by publishing.

813
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,970
We need
to have alternatives.

814
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,371
Listen, Ed,

815
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,841
the real issue here is that
they, the White House,

816
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,208
are aware that Janine has a leaked
top secret FISA court order.

817
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,486
Anything could happen.

818
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,971
They could subpoena
the Guardian

819
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,121
and, for that matter,
they could

820
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,565
break through
that door any minute,

821
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,608
ending all of this.

822
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,887
We are running
out of time.

823
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,043
We seriously have to think about
doing this on our own website.

824
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,446
We have no choice.

825
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,329
Wait, you can't just
start dumping articles

826
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,249
on the Internet, Glenn!
Be serious.

827
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,005
Look at WikiLeaks. It
destroyed their credibility.

828
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,650
Look, Ed,
you said it yourself,

829
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,167
if this isn't done properly, the
world isn't gonna take notice.

830
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,608
You need experienced
journalists to lead the public

831
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,160
through some very,
very complicated stories.

832
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,765
We are
experienced journalists.

833
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,685
My feeling...

834
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,169
Has anyone called here before? Not once.
Not in three weeks.

835
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,844
Well, I'll...
Shall I answer it?

836
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,610
I'll tell 'em it's
the wrong number.

837
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,441
Yes?

838
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,365
No, I don't.

839
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,450
Okay. Thank you.

840
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,203
Asking if I want
turndown service.

841
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,760
She said the "Do not disturb"
sign was off the door.

842
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,041
So?

843
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,323
Do we wait?
Or go on our own?

844
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,201
Look, I said
from the beginning

845
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,324
that how you publish
is your business,

846
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,164
and I trust you.

847
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,971
The only thing I ask is you study
the data, you be responsible,

848
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,731
no names, no specifics,
anything ongoing

849
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,962
that's critical,
you don't release.

850
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,441
You just stick to the issue
of mass surveillance

851
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,567
and let the people decide.

852
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,723
You have our word on that, but
that's not the question. We have to ask...

853
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,490
Look, Ed,

854
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,961
right now the White House is
arranging a conference call

855
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,122
between Janine and
the intelligence services.

856
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,283
Now that's gonna happen
in a few hours.

857
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,251
Let's at least wait for that,
see what they say to her.

858
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,888
I'd say we pause a moment.

859
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,571
Yeah, I think
we should reassemble

860
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,085
in this room after
the call takes place,

861
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,841
so that's around midnight.
Be noon in New York.

862
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,125
All right.

863
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,521
I'll take another pass at the
PRISM story in the meantime.

864
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,491
Okay. We'll be in our hotel
room if you need us, okay?

865
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,561
Thanks, Ewen.

866
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,210
Do you mind maybe
we take a break from that?

867
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,090
For a second?

868
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,681
Yeah. Sure, sorry.

869
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,208
You wanna take a look?
Might make you feel better.

870
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,051
On. It's not
recording, just on standby.

871
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,486
When did this start for you?
Not wanting your photo taken?

872
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,161
Probably in Japan.

873
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,720
I remember every time
a camera got pointed at me,

874
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,167
it was like...
couldn't breathe.

875
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,605
Why was that?

876
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,449
I probably, spent too much time
looking at other people through cameras.

877
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,881
Japan was your
first NSA job, right?

878
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,921
Yeah, well, as a contractor with Dell.
Had a lot of access.

879
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,402
Why'd you go
back after Geneva?

880
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,161
'Cause the money, and 'cause
I wanted to live in Japan.

881
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,004
And because of Obama,
actually.

882
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,731
You know, I thought things were
gonna get better with him.

883
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,491
I was wrong.

884
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,201
What was it like there?

885
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,248
Well,
in the first part of my day,

886
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,530
I was building this round-the-clock
backup system called Epic Shelter.

887
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,126
So, if there was
some catastrophe,

888
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,090
say, terrorists
burned down every embassy

889
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,731
and NSA post in
the Middle East.

890
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,488
This program would ensure we
wouldn't lose any of that data.

891
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,566
But then, I would have to put it
aside when visitors would show up.

892
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,521
NSA wanted to impress the
Japanese, show them our reach.

893
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,245
They loved
the live drone feeds.

894
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,482
This is over Pakistan.

895
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,731
Right now.

896
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,007
They were not as thrilled to
learn that we wanted them to help us

897
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,208
spy on
the Japanese population.

898
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,085
They said it was
against their laws.

899
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,402
Course we tapped
the entire country anyway.

900
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,328
And we didn't stop there,

901
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,562
'cause once we owned
their communications systems,

902
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,564
we started going after
their physical infrastructure.

903
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,929
We'd slip these little sleeper
programs into power grids,

904
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,968
dams, hospitals,

905
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,122
and the idea was
if the day came

906
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,601
when Japan was
no longer an ally,

907
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,011
it'd be lights out.

908
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,486
And it wasn't
just the Japanese.

909
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,087
We were planting malware
in Mexico, Germany,

910
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,844
Brazil, Austria.

911
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,927
I mean, China I can understand,
or Russia, or Iran,

912
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,685
or Venezuela, okay.
But Austria?

913
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,489
You're also being ordered
to follow most world leaders

914
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,164
and heads of industry.

915
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,562
You know, you're tracking
trade deals, sex scandals,

916
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,565
diplomatic cables
to give the U.S.

917
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,120
an advantage in
negotiations at the G8,

918
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,807
or leverage over
Brazilian oil companies,

919
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,044
or helping to oust some third-world
leader who's not playing ball.

920
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,641
And ultimately,
the truth sinks in

921
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,564
that no matter what justification
you're selling yourself,

922
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,927
this is not about terrorism.

923
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,289
Terrorism is the excuse.

924
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,962
This is about economic
and social control.

925
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,086
And the only thing
you're really protecting

926
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,561
is the supremacy
of your government.

927
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,003
Were you thinking about
going to journalists then?

928
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,050
No, that wouldn't have
occurred to me back then.

929
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,690
I just thought, you know,
the system will self-correct,

930
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,287
and the President will keep his
promise that got him elected...

931
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,206
That's actually when I first started
reading about you and your films.

932
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,361
It was in Glenn's blog.

933
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,523
You were being detained
in airports for hours.

934
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,446
Thirty-seven times. For investigating
your own country's wars.

935
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,123
That's why I'm going back to Berlin
to edit. You can trust me with this.

936
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,802
I do. Yeah.

937
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,726
I haven't trusted
anyone in years.

938
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:21,569
It was a welcome change when they
put me on terrorism watch duty.

939
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,926
Every day, I'd go in and I'd get
starting points for SIGINT,

940
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,646
which is signals intelligence.

941
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,926
A lot of them were American,
which felt strange,

942
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,843
but you just keep
reminding yourself,

943
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,925
I could stop a dirty bomb attack
and save thousands of lives.

944
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,962
The thing is, you're not just
following your bad guy targets.

945
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,611
You're also following
their metadata,

946
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,685
which is basically all the phone
numbers that they're in touch with.

947
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,321
Let's say your target
is a shady Iranian banker

948
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,926
operating out of Beirut,
okay.

949
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,446
So you're watching his stuff,
but you're also watching

950
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,966
all the people
that he talks to.

951
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,646
Including,
you know, his cousin,

952
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,291
who's just some dentist
living in Buffalo.

953
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,170
And then you have to watch
all of that guy's contacts.

954
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,608
And by the time you go a third hop
out from the original target,

955
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,210
you're watching this bartender
chat with her mother about Botox.

956
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,286
'Cause three hops from anyone
with, say, 40 contacts,

957
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,011
you're looking at a list
of 2.5 million people.

958
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,688
And there's that
moment when

959
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,367
you're sitting there and
the scale of it hits you.

960
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,128
The NSA is really tracking
every cell phone in the world.

961
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,049
No matter who you are,

962
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,811
every day of your life,
you're sitting in a database

963
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,486
just ready
to be looked at.

964
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,683
And not just terrorists, or
countries, or corporations, but you.

965
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,288
Was Lindsay with you
in Japan?

966
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,687
Japan was difficult
for us.

967
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,648
I guess you couldn't
talk about your work.

968
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,561
There was this one night,
towards the end,

969
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,170
when, we were supposed to go
climb Mount Fuji the next day...

970
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,880
Are you gonna
post that on Twitter?

971
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,961
No.

972
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,726
They're just for me.
What do you think?

973
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,243
You should delete those.

974
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,091
That's not quite the artistic
critique I was going for.

975
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,044
I'm sorry.

976
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,929
You can't have stuff like
that on your hard drive.

977
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,047
Yes, I can.

978
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:10,091
I'm asking you, can you delete them?

979
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,171
Russian hackers again?

980
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,287
No...

981
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,171
Is it us?

982
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,086
It's classified.

983
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,880
Am I a target?

984
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,200
Of course not.

985
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,767
Clearly someone is looking
at my nude portraits.

986
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,729
Okay. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

987
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,121
All right? It's issues
of national security.

988
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,362
Well, I am flattered
that my boobs

989
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,323
are considered an issue
of national security,

990
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,124
but you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

991
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,680
I'd rather not talk about stuff
that could land us in jail.

992
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,524
So that's what
the Band-Aids are about, then?

993
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,443
And your camera phobia?

994
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,726
Because of work?

995
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,125
Are they watching us?

996
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,490
Who are they watching?
No one, okay?

997
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,210
Let's just stop
talking about it.

998
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,961
Let's go to bed,
and wake up in the morning,

999
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,647
and go climb this mountain.
All right?

1000
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,091
Of course we're not
gonna talk about it.

1001
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,486
What is that
supposed to mean?

1002
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,040
It means that we don't talk
about anything anymore.

1003
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,366
You work 12-hour days,
you come home depressed,

1004
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,807
you play video games,
and then you fall asleep.

1005
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,564
Yeah, I'm tired
'cause I have a job.

1006
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,051
That's what pays
for this apartment

1007
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,849
in the most expensive city
in the world.

1008
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,163
Which you asked me to come to knowing
that I did not have a work visa.

1009
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,480
Okay, what if
you had one?

1010
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,087
Would you really give up your
beautiful life of eating and sleeping

1011
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,726
and going out all the time? You
think you'd really want a career?

1012
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,168
A career like yours? Where I'm
miserable all the time? No.

1013
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,402
That's called
responsibility.

1014
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,083
You know what?
You have no idea

1015
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,845
what it's like to be accountable
for other people's lives,

1016
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,002
because you live
in a fairy tale land

1017
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,003
where just there
are no consequences,

1018
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,684
and no one ever gets hurt.

1019
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,083
No, you don't get hurt.

1020
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,931
I get crushed.

1021
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,849
Bullshit!
I've done nothing to you!

1022
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,888
That's exactly right.
You have done nothing!

1023
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,002
You don't hang out with me,
you don't laugh with me,

1024
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,924
you don't even touch me anymore.

1025
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,400
I'm sorry.
Stop!

1026
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,127
We never made it to Mount Fuji.

1027
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,281
And Lindsay left pretty
soon after that, and...

1028
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,530
I was really lonely there.

1029
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,202
But after three months, I left too.
I went back to Maryland.

1030
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,244
And I promised her
I'd change.

1031
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,083
And we moved
back in together.

1032
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,491
Make
sure your knees stay bent,

1033
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,524
and then you can fully extend
once you feel stable. Ready?

1034
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,648
One, two, three.

1035
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,321
All the way up.

1036
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,930
Now you wanna clench
between your knees.

1037
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,446
It'll burn,
but it's a good burn.

1038
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,487
Perfect.

1039
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,005
Twirl around.

1040
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,841
Perfect! I'm so proud of you!

1041
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,763
When you're really happy,

1042
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,208
there's a large part of you
that just wants to stay happy.

1043
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,523
And you start to think, what could
be more important than this?

1044
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,205
What!
Is it okay?

1045
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,048
It's so beautiful.

1046
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,645
You know, lots of people
cruise happily through life.

1047
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,730
Why can't I?

1048
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,290
And I went back
to work at the CIA.

1049
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,044
With backdoors...

1050
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,885
My official title was
Solutions Consultant.

1051
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,049
Basically I was hawking
overpriced hardware for a living.

1052
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,804
But I thought
you had resigned?

1053
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,360
Yeah, well, it was all
contract work after Geneva.

1054
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,681
You know,
it's Booz Allen Hamilton,

1055
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,888
or Dell, in partnership

1056
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,009
With CIA or NSA, DIA.

1057
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,645
That's the intelligence
community's revolving door.

1058
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,640
How was it?
Being back in the States?

1059
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,681
It was really good to be home.

1060
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,130
But Maryland was where things
started to turn for me.

1061
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,568
Every time I felt like I was finally
letting go of all the anxiety

1062
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,246
and all the questions that
used to keep me up at night,

1063
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,245
I'd learn something else,
and I just couldn't ignore it.

1064
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,240
Like, there were these three
high-level officials at the NSA,

1065
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,051
Bill Binney, Ed Loomis,
and Kirk Wiebe.

1066
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,330
They'd been filing complaints about
abuse and overreach for years.

1067
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,200
That's all they did,
they just filed complaints,

1068
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,443
and the FBI
raided their homes.

1069
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,085
Then there was Thomas Drake.

1070
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,128
Like the other three guys,
Drake was trying

1071
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,487
to change things
from the inside.

1072
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,961
But when nothing worked,
he did go to the press.

1073
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,965
So they hit him with the Espionage
Act, and we were shocked.

1074
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,963
The whole Intel community.

1075
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,371
Why do you
think you were charged?

1076
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,965
To send a chilling message.

1077
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,361
To whom?

1078
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,011
To other whistleblowers,
to others in the government,

1079
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,202
not to speak out.

1080
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,330
Do not tell truth to power.
We'll hammer you.

1081
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,571
There's a new
program being developed

1082
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,007
at the NSA's op
center on Oahu.

1083
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,561
You'd be going up against
Chinese cyber divisions.

1084
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,001
You interested?

1085
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,928
Won't be the vast sums of
money you're making now,

1086
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,480
but you'd be performing a critical
service for your country.

1087
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,891
I know that's
important to you.

1088
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,281
You mean service
like in Geneva?

1089
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,204
Matt was a mistake. Shouldn't
have pushed you into that.

1090
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,327
You didn't push me
into it.

1091
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,528
I asked for exposure to field
ops, you gave it to me.

1092
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,329
I won't hold that
against you.

1093
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,840
Is there something
you do hold against me?

1094
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,206
You didn't tell me
we were running

1095
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,521
a dragnet on
the whole world, Corbin.

1096
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,400
Great shooting, Ed.

1097
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,811
Thank you.

1098
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,850
That's terrific.

1099
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,721
It's the one thing
in the Army I was good at.

1100
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,449
You ever think, Ed,

1101
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,367
since the Second World War, it's
been 60 years and still no WW III.

1102
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,406
Why?

1103
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,325
Because we've used our power
generally for the good of the world.

1104
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,930
For prosperity, order.

1105
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,889
How can we defend
ourselves against

1106
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,169
nuclear war, terror attacks,
cyber-attacks

1107
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,641
without a centralized
Intel factory

1108
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,609
working around the world
night and day?

1109
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,244
So we should catalogue
billions of people's lives?

1110
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,688
Most people already catalogue
their lives for public consumption.

1111
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,923
Well, they catalogue part cf their
lives, and they do it by choice.

1112
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,441
We're not giving them the choice.
We're just taking everything.

1113
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:58,286
Most Americans don't want
freedom, they want security.

1114
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,690
It's a simple bargain. If...

1115
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,768
Good girl! Good girl!

1116
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,364
If you want to play
with all the new toys

1117
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,410
and be safe, you pay
the price of admission.

1118
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,651
Yeah, except people,

1119
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,484
they don't even know
they've made that bargain.

1120
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,801
Where's the modern
battlefield, soldier?

1121
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,641
Everywhere.

1122
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,361
What's the first rule of battle?

1123
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,124
Never reveal
your position.

1124
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:29,881
And if one unauthorized person knew?
If Congress knew?

1125
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,724
So would the enemy.

1126
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,850
That, Mr. Snowden,
is the state of the world.

1127
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,601
Secrecy is security,
and security is victory.

1128
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,890
Thank you, sir.

1129
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,720
Someone I want you
to meet.

1130
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,768
Beautiful day for it, wasn't it?
Perfect weather.

1131
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,320
Mr. Lowell. Jim.

1132
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,768
How are you?
Dorian.

1133
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,205
Alan.
Nice to see you.

1134
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,406
Welcome to the U.S.

1135
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,050
How'd you make
out today, Corbin?

1136
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,970
Very mediocre.
Nothing like Ed here.

1137
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,404
Apparently the Army's training
people to shoot straight.

1138
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,289
So this is Ed Snowden.

1139
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,566
Yes, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

1140
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,081
The brains behind Epic Shelter.
That's right.

1141
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,446
That's brilliant work.
Thank you, sir.

1142
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,965
Yeah, I had a few questions
I wanted to ask you.

1143
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,884
Jim. Will you
excuse me, gentlemen?

1144
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,731
Excuse me, Alan.
Nice to meet you.

1145
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,003
Yeah, it's proving very useful
to our UAV program.

1146
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,289
Yes, I heard. With foreign
site Intel transfer.

1147
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,964
Transfers happen
on collection now.

1148
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,362
They go straight to the Pentagon,
Mossad if they need it.

1149
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,205
Actionable immediately.
No one sees it.

1150
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,646
It's improved
the response time

1151
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,609
of our drone pilots
by a factor of ten.

1152
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,647
Tell me, Ed. You worked signals
intelligence in Japan too, yes?

1153
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,801
Yes, sir.

1154
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,644
How'd you like it?

1155
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,247
It was a very empowering job, sir.

1156
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,524
With this new job in Hawaii,
you'd have even more access.

1157
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,730
I asked Corbin to start the conversation.
But the offer is mine.

1158
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,364
Take your time.

1159
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,566
It's going to
take a few months

1160
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,961
to get this program
on its feet.

1161
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,691
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen, I see dinner.

1162
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,609
Beer, sir?
Thank you.

1163
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,089
Sir, for you?
No, thank you.

1164
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,808
Epic Shelter was meant
as a backup program.

1165
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,527
Lowell is creating
this position for you, Ed.

1166
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,206
You'd be the first contractor
outside Fort Meade

1167
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,930
working counter-cyber.

1168
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,202
It's your ticket to the top.

1169
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,964
Do
You believe the United States

1170
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,008
is the greatest country
in the world?

1171
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,730
Yes.

1172
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,241
Have you ever used

1173
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,005
any programs
you were unauthorized for?

1174
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,007
No.

1175
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,205
We're not usually
supposed to submit our own work,

1176
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,568
but my editor said
she'd make an exception.

1177
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,687
Pretty neat?

1178
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,162
I get to
submit an entry.

1179
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,966
You ignoring me
on purpose, or what?

1180
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,566
No. Sorry.

1181
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,367
I was just thinking.

1182
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,686
About what?

1183
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,361
I wanted to talk to you
about it at dinner,

1184
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,681
but let's just...
Will you come sit down?

1185
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,242
Is everything okay?

1186
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,526
Yeah.

1187
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,531
The Deputy Director
of the NSA...

1188
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,402
He offered me
a new position.

1189
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,530
And, that was a while back,
and now they need an answer.

1190
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,882
Well, is it something
you want to do?

1191
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,089
I'd be good at it.

1192
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,520
Can you tell me anything about it?

1193
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,564
You know I can't.

1194
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,484
I know. Mission first.

1195
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,246
Well, are there social perks?
White House galas, maybe?

1196
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,445
The position
is in Hawaii.

1197
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,290
We worked really hard
to get where we're at.

1198
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,963
And you're willing to
just rip it all up again?

1199
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,929
Like we finally have
a house that we love,

1200
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,843
and a job that I like,
and real friends,

1201
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,922
and we're close to our families.
I... I understand.

1202
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,890
And if you want to stay,
then we're staying.

1203
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,526
That's it.

1204
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,330
Don't just say that
'cause I wanna hear it.

1205
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,441
I'm not.

1206
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,087
I let you go once,
I'm not gonna do it again.

1207
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,803
I'm sorry.
The pasta.

1208
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,490
One sec.

1209
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,325
You know, I think I actually
came pretty close

1210
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,448
to getting it
right this time.

1211
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,285
I'll get some candles.

1212
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,725
I know Tegretol.

1213
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,888
I know it slows you down,
'cause I've seen it in my mom.

1214
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,691
She's taken all kinds
of medications her whole life.

1215
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,726
Well, they work
in 70% of cases.

1216
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,443
Ed, epilepsy is
a serious condition.

1217
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,444
If you have a seizure
driving yourself,

1218
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,648
or with someone else
in the car,

1219
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,122
or you're in a place
where you could fall,

1220
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,726
this is not something
to be lightly regarded.

1221
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,565
It's essential you commit
yourself to this medication.

1222
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,125
After you.
Thank you.

1223
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,324
I've been thinking about
what the doctor said.

1224
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,925
About less stress.

1225
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,568
A warmer climate
could help.

1226
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,925
If Hawaii is something
that we decide

1227
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,209
would be better
for you, I'll go.

1228
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,366
Janine, how'd the White
House conversation go?

1229
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,441
I made it quite clear

1230
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,444
that we were in possession of
an authentic FISA court order.

1231
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,000
They wanted to see it.
We refused.

1232
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,447
Now I just pray that
it's actually authentic.

1233
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,689
Are you actually
questioning that?

1234
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,610
Glenn, no one has ever seen
a FISA court order.

1235
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,370
There's no precedent here.

1236
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,410
Our source risked his life
for that document. It's real.

1237
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,687
Tell us, did the White House
make any specific claims

1238
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,128
about national security that would
prevent you from publishing?

1239
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:45,011
No. I asked them repeatedly, and
they had no substantive answer.

1240
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,411
Then, there you go!
What more do you want?

1241
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,244
You can go out and
know that you're safe.

1242
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,325
Glenn, I'd like to talk to
Alan before we go any further.

1243
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,447
When does he land?

1244
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,726
In six hours.

1245
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,804
No. Absolutely not! We're
sitting ducks here, Janine.

1246
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,651
It's 1:00 p.m.
in New York.

1247
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,404
If you don't get this out
in the next four hours,

1248
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,244
you'll miss the evening news
on the East Coast.

1249
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,800
But we can post
later tonight.

1250
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,287
I'm sorry, Glenn.

1251
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,567
But Alan's our editor-in-chief,
and I really think that...

1252
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,490
Bullshit! The government knows
that we have these documents now.

1253
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,922
The CIA could barge through this door
any minute, and you want more time!

1254
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,850
Act like a journalist
and stop stringing us along!

1255
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,083
I just stood my ground
with the goddamn White House!

1256
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,446
I've risked my career!

1257
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,443
How dare you question
my commitment to this story!

1258
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,885
Okay, let's just
keep our voices down...

1259
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,086
No, you're right.
I am questioning it.

1260
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,521
This is absolutely
inappropriate.

1261
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,368
We are publishing ourselves.
You're out.

1262
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,121
All right, Glenn.

1263
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,521
We'll have it ready
by 4:00 p.m.

1264
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,044
I have to go over the
story once more-Why?

1265
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,931
Because it still
needs editing, damn you.

1266
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,924
All this intelligence
jargon is hurting our brains.

1267
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,686
This PRISM story is
still incomprehensible.

1268
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,250
PRISM is the second story,
Janine.

1269
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,169
Verizon is the first story.

1270
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,806
Have it ready to post by 4:00
p.m., 5:00 at the latest.

1271
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,486
No games, or we're gone.

1272
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,325
So, my new job
was counter-spying

1273
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,247
on the Chinese at the NSA Regional
Cryptological Center on Oahu.

1274
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,607
You mind placing your
bag down there, sir?

1275
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,444
No personal laptops, no USB
sticks, no cell phones,

1276
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,965
no electronic devices
of any kind?

1277
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,121
No, sir.

1278
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,927
Thank you.

1279
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,564
Snow White!
Is that you?

1280
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,007
Gabriel?

1281
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,487
Dude, what the hell are you doing here?

1282
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,607
That's amazing.

1283
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,121
What, do you work here?

1284
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,649
Yeah. Three years,
two months, and five days.

1285
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,883
But who's counting, right?

1286
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,248
It's like who knew a secret
underground World War II-era base

1287
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,402
would become munchie heaven
for a thousand geeks, right?

1288
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,005
So there's good pizza?
Good pizza, yeah.

1289
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,081
That's important.

1290
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,730
Elevator's slow
as shit, though.

1291
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,080
It's something
else, huh?

1292
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,282
Yeah. So, what deck
are you working on?

1293
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,011
You NTOC or ROC?

1294
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,923
Between you and me? NTOC.

1295
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,525
Cool. You get to
hack the hackers.

1296
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,840
You're coming up
in the world.

1297
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,246
Fresh
brains for you, Trevor.

1298
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,527
Trevor James, Interactive
Ops Division Chief.

1299
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,601
Ed Snowden.

1300
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,206
I've been briefed.
Next door is NTOC.

1301
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,202
Defense. That's where
you'll be working.

1302
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,242
Over here we have ROC,
our offense.

1303
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,442
Now I move between the two. We
run a tight ship here, Snowden.

1304
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,200
You'll be working
with Haynes.

1305
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,725
Patrick Haynes.

1306
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,131
Nice to meet you.
Good to have you.

1307
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,440
You watch out for him.

1308
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,284
That's the smartest guy
in the building right here.

1309
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,965
Bro, how many languages
you speak, again?

1310
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,044
I mean, seven in code,
six spoken, two signs.

1311
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,121
That's cool.

1312
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,244
Great. Another language
I can't understand.

1313
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,685
I'll check you
later, Ed.

1314
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,841
Okay. See you.

1315
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,605
Wait for it.

1316
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,242
Any moment.

1317
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,047
We got 'em.

1318
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,406
Lights over
Waziristan, gentlemen.

1319
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,121
Way to go.

1320
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,931
So what exactly do we
contribute to this?

1321
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,647
The underside of
that Reaper drone

1322
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,484
is fixed with
a big-ass antenna,

1323
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,331
snarfing the hardware ID
of anything that broadcasts.

1324
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,687
We do the geolocator.

1325
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,886
My friend Tasha
here at the Air Force

1326
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,610
rains hellfire.
There she is now.

1327
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,843
Trev.
You liking the show?

1328
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,482
You know it. We track 'em,
you whack 'em.

1329
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,404
And who
did we just track?

1330
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,764
Not who, what.

1331
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:42,003
We're targeting bad guys' cell phones.
Sometimes the SIM card.

1332
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,521
Okay, and how do we
know the bad guy

1333
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,204
is in possession of
the bad cell phone

1334
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,441
when we strike?

1335
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,567
Well, we don't...

1336
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,650
Course we do. JSOC and CIA have
their people in the field.

1337
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,490
What's the program name?

1338
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,850
Epic Shelter.

1339
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,083
It was originally some
backup program for...

1340
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,561
Catastrophic site failure.

1341
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,648
Yeah. How did
you know that?

1342
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,047
I built it.

1343
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,289
I've been thinking about,

1344
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,562
another use
for Epic Shelter.

1345
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:14,687
What'd you have
in mind?

1346
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,608
Well, I was chatting
with Jim Lowell

1347
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,681
about how there's
so many programs...

1348
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,807
Deputy Director Lowell?

1349
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,042
Yeah.

1350
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,367
And we were saying there's
so many programs nowadays,

1351
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,488
it's kind of impossible to keep
track of them anymore, right?

1352
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,245
So why not create
a centralized database.

1353
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,085
Like an index.

1354
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,481
Yeah, exactly. Something
that updates in real time,

1355
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,281
you know, we've already got Epic
Shelter collecting our finished Intel.

1356
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,842
We just need a web portal to
catalogue it, make it searchable.

1357
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,371
Let me think about it.

1358
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,442
In any case, I'd have to
run it past Fort Meade.

1359
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,567
Of course.

1360
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,801
Did you have a name?

1361
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,007
Yeah, if it's not taken,
I'd call it Heartbeat.

1362
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,211
Heartbeat. FEMALE DRONE
PILOT: Six, five, four,

1363
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,688
three, two, one...

1364
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,091
Engage target.

1365
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,605
You okay down there?

1366
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,847
Yep.

1367
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,365
See, this is why I keep saying
we need to hike more.

1368
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,486
You're right.

1369
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,041
Can you
look at me?

1370
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,360
Come on. It's been years.

1371
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,370
By social media standards,
you don't even exist anymore.

1372
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,041
Just one.

1373
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,047
Okay, smile. Show me your teeth!

1374
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,491
My elusive E,
finally captured.

1375
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,449
So now I'm
a viable boyfriend?

1376
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,726
Yes.

1377
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,051
Such a shame, you used to be
such a cute little model.

1378
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,368
Was I little?
Wait!

1379
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,925
Stop!

1380
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,808
What?

1381
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,843
Think you got some sun!

1382
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,002
I'm serious,
it looks good!

1383
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,445
Well, that's impossible.

1384
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,207
I've been meaning
to ask you, by the way.

1385
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,611
Did you switch
pharmacies?

1386
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,048
'Cause I tried to pick up
your prescription,

1387
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,443
and I couldn't.

1388
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,760
Why did you do that?

1389
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,722
Because I was there and
thought it would be helpful.

1390
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,003
I stopped taking
the Tegretol.

1391
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,451
What? When?

1392
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,204
A couple months ago.

1393
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,361
And you're just
now telling me?

1394
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,204
I wanted to tell you.

1395
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,568
I did, I can't take that
stuff, it makes me groggy,

1396
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,120
and I need to be
sharp for work.

1397
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,850
I need to be on the
ball all the time.

1398
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,046
What is it about
this job

1399
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,600
that makes it more
important than your life?

1400
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,326
I don't understand.

1401
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,731
Our government...

1402
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,811
Our government, what?

1403
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:18,122
Our government is hemorrhaging
billions of dollars

1404
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,726
every year
to Chinese hackers.

1405
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,326
And I've been hired
to shut them down.

1406
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,800
A lot of people
are depending on me.

1407
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,843
More so than
anyone else?

1408
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,481
Yes.

1409
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,166
No, this is bullshit.

1410
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,730
We didn't come to Hawaii
for you to heal, did we?

1411
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,207
There was never gonna be
a less stressful job out here.

1412
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,124
Look, I feel like
I'm made to do this.

1413
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:00,161
And if I don't do it, then I don't
know anybody else that can.

1414
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:07,527
It's like I'm on a trajectory
that I can't turn back from.

1415
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,170
You can
always turn back.

1416
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,886
What I wanted to see

1417
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,407
is if you could give me a yes
or no answer to the question,

1418
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,883
"Does the NSA collect
any type of data at all

1419
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,407
"on millions or hundreds
of millions of Americans?"

1420
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,561
No, sir.

1421
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,645
It does not?

1422
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,810
Not wittingly.

1423
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,486
There are cases where
they could inadvertently,

1424
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,449
perhaps, collect,

1425
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,124
but not wittingly.

1426
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,406
Really?

1427
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,448
Thank you, and
I'll have additional questions

1428
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,409
to give you in writing
on that point.

1429
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,401
What I wanted to
show you guys is,

1430
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:57,007
the slide I ran across while
building this indexing program.

1431
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,447
And what is this?

1432
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,330
Okay. So, this is
data collection

1433
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,323
for the month of March

1434
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,681
worldwide,
emails and Skype calls.

1435
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:11,086
So France, 70 million. Germany,
500 million. Brazil, two billion.

1436
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,848
Inside the U.S.,

1437
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,163
3.1 billion emails and calls.

1438
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,607
That's not including any of
the telecom company data.

1439
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,523
Okay, so what's
the collection in Russia?

1440
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,647
Russia is 1.5 billion.

1441
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,370
Wait, so we're collecting
twice as much

1442
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,044
in the U.S.
as we are in Russia?

1443
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,201
Yeah, I figured it
was a lot, but...

1444
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,521
This shit
is out of hand, man.

1445
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,682
Wait. Have you shown
this to anyone else?

1446
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,529
No, you guys
are the first.

1447
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,847
Yeah, you know, I'd
be careful about that.

1448
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,888
You know, it could seem
like you're rocking the boat.

1449
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,961
Yeah, you're right.

1450
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,247
No, I needed to know

1451
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,641
if I was the only one that
thought this was crazy.

1452
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,725
What is going on?

1453
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,847
Trev.

1454
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,967
What are you doing
in here?

1455
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,280
It's nothing.
I was just showing them

1456
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,806
this one slide,
I needed some input.

1457
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,006
Why the heat map?

1458
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,730
It's my bad, Trev.

1459
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,802
I made a bet with Ed
about which country

1460
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,486
we were collecting
the most signals from.

1461
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,483
He said Iran,
I said Pakistan.

1462
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,005
Who won?

1463
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,766
Ed.

1464
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,641
Yeah, I need to
head out. I'll see you guys.

1465
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,921
You're going
down next time, man.

1466
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,930
No more bets.

1467
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,002
And I don't want anyone
unauthorized in here again.

1468
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,525
Especially not
with Heartbeat.

1469
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,329
You're right.
Won't happen again.

1470
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,365
Happy birthday!

1471
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,569
In Vegas,
looking at Afghanistan.

1472
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,768
So we're running late hours.

1473
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,645
So this blurry object comes
wandering into the strike zone.

1474
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,249
We all knew
that it was a kid.

1475
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,921
He's gone.

1476
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,287
We called in for clarification,
and the report came back

1477
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,089
that it was a dog.

1478
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,245
Okay. Fine.

1479
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,010
Shift's long, day and night.
I don't remember.

1480
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:14,004
But same village,
two, three days later.

1481
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,366
We see the funeral party.

1482
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,647
We knew it was a kid
that they were burying.

1483
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,927
Moms and dads wailing.

1484
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,731
And then the order comes down.
Pretty clear. Hit 'em.

1485
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,401
Poof

1486
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,490
And they are gone
in a cloud of dust.

1487
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,171
I mean, all of them.
The whole fuckin' family.

1488
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,803
But the crazy thing is,

1489
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,723
you come home after work,

1490
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,930
kiss your wife, your kids,
back to work the next day.

1491
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:50,171
Pretty soon, you know,
it just all becomes routine.

1492
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,525
Fuck that.

1493
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,400
You make it sound criminal, man.
It's war. It's a job.

1494
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:02,121
I don't know, man. You
saying jobs can't be criminal?

1495
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,290
Not if you're working
for the government.

1496
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,765
You ever hear about
the Nuremberg trials, Trev?

1497
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,370
They weren't that long ago.

1498
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,523
Yeah. And we hung
the Nazi big shots, right?

1499
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,527
Yeah, well, the big shots
were the first trial,

1500
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:20,525
but then the next trial
were just the judges,

1501
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,604
and lawyers,
and policemen, and guards,

1502
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:28,288
and ordinary people just doing
their jobs, following orders.

1503
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,608
That's where we got
the Nuremberg principles,

1504
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:35,810
which then the UN made
into international law,

1505
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,363
just in case ordinary jobs
become criminal again.

1506
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,926
Just saying.

1507
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,086
That's gotta
wake you up. You okay?

1508
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,605
See, I told you
not to grab my hand.

1509
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,682
Dude, are you okay?

1510
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,205
Ed, are you okay?

1511
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,089
I think he's having a...

1512
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,884
Get away,
don't touch him.

1513
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,610
Don't touch him.

1514
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,565
How are you?
How's your health?

1515
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,128
Hey, Corbin.

1516
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,966
It's fine.
Thanks for asking.

1517
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,931
Must be nerve-wrecking
living with that condition.

1518
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,243
You wouldn't know it
to look at your numbers.

1519
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,403
Two hundred Chinese IPs down
in your first four months.

1520
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,564
Those are
internal numbers.

1521
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,247
Your colleague, Trevor,
comes out of the CIA like you.

1522
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,126
He's been keeping me
informed on your progress.

1523
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,763
It's outstanding
work. Heartbeat as well.

1524
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,564
Thank you.
That means a lot.

1525
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,769
Lowell is very pleased.
He sends his regards.

1526
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,640
That's great to hear.

1527
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,730
He doesn't know about
your heat map conversations,

1528
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,963
or some of the ideas you've
expressed to your colleagues.

1529
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,131
And he's not going to.

1530
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,485
You know, Heartbeat
is proving a tricky project.

1531
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,528
Collating from
multiple agencies,

1532
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,080
and knowing
where to pull from.

1533
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,369
It has helped to talk
it over with colleagues.

1534
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,245
I believe in you, Ed.

1535
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:35,168
Which is why nothing happened to
you after the derog in Geneva.

1536
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,811
And I'm very grateful
you've looked out for me.

1537
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,001
Or after you,

1538
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,090
omitted the truth
in your last polygraph.

1539
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,051
What was it you were
withholding exactly?

1540
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,451
You remember
that day in class,

1541
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,285
you were talking to us
about the FISA Court?

1542
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:06,366
You said that they approved
Bush's wiretapping programs.

1543
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,203
Sometimes we're restricted
from telling the whole truth.

1544
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,281
Doesn't give us
permission to lie.

1545
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,443
Come on, Corbin,

1546
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,569
the Director of National
Intelligence just lied to Congress!

1547
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,207
Sorry.

1548
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,725
Look at me.

1549
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,285
Did you access
an unauthorized program

1550
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,886
that I did not know about?

1551
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,211
Yes.

1552
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,809
It was at Geneva.
It was Lindsay.

1553
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,166
I was jealous.

1554
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,251
And I'm sorry.
I never did it again.

1555
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,241
Listen, Ed.

1556
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,687
I know it's been up and down with
you and Lindsay since Geneva.

1557
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,684
It's tough to keep any relationship going.
Few of us do.

1558
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,163
So, if it'll give you any peace
of mind, I can assure you,

1559
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,882
she's not sleeping with that
photographer friend of hers.

1560
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,089
If that's what
you're thinking.

1561
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,689
I have to go to
a Five Eyes conference

1562
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,489
in Sydney in
a couple of weeks.

1563
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,801
I'll stop off in Hawaii
on the way back.

1564
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,205
Okay. Thank you.

1565
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,971
I'll see you soon.

1566
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:25,084
Good. Did you get the e-mail
that I sent you with the photos?

1567
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,323
Well, I was hoping that
you could send me some...

1568
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,007
What are you doing?

1569
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,241
Sit down.

1570
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,364
Your e-mail is
being monitored.

1571
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,207
So?

1572
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,967
No, it's different now.

1573
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,520
It's not passive collection,
it's full-take surveillance.

1574
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:25,486
It's all of your e-mails, calls,
texts, social media, everything.

1575
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,009
It's also possible
that the house is bugged.

1576
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,440
I'm not sure.

1577
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,246
By who?

1578
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,410
By a senior officer
at the CIA.

1579
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,006
You in trouble?
Is it the Chinese thing?

1580
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,441
Look, there's things
that I wish I could tell you,

1581
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:50,411
but I can't because
you could get very hurt.

1582
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,810
What's keeping you safe is
that you don't know anything.

1583
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,962
I'm sorry, I really am. I didn't
want any of this for you.

1584
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,448
But I know you would think
I was doing the right thing.

1585
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,323
So just listen to me
for a sec, okay?

1586
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,483
When we go back in the house,
everything has to appear normal.

1587
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,688
We're gonna act like
nothing has changed,

1588
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,206
but if you do notice
something that's weird,

1589
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,123
you need to
tell me right away.

1590
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:31,608
And you're gonna use an encrypted
e-mail that I'm setting up for you.

1591
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,047
I don't think I can do this.

1592
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,690
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

1593
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,170
Do I even have a choice?

1594
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,884
I'm asking you
to trust me.

1595
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,686
And, Linds,
I think it'd be best

1596
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,366
if you went back
to Maryland for a while.

1597
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,761
Tell your parents that I'm
away on a business trip

1598
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,286
and that you're homesick.

1599
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,084
Are you going away?

1600
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,720
Yes. But just
for a little while.

1601
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,481
No, I can't go.

1602
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,005
Just until I get back.

1603
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,206
I can't go.

1604
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:25,963
You just said that we have to
appear like nothing's changed.

1605
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:29,642
If both of us left at the same time,
wouldn't that seem suspicious?

1606
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,650
I will do this for you.

1607
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,643
But it is the last time.

1608
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,166
You hear about Trevor, bro?

1609
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,321
No, what?

1610
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,801
You remember that op
to own the Internet in Syria?

1611
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,086
Yeah.

1612
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,640
Trevor and his TAO team
crashed the core router.

1613
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,810
Bro, the whole
country's gone dark.

1614
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,767
Figure it out!

1615
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,927
Poor bastards.

1616
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,089
Okay, I gotta get to work.

1617
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,207
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1618
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,170
How's Heartbeat coming?

1619
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,041
It's close.

1620
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,921
It's very close.

1621
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:57,771
Pull it up
on this monitor.

1622
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,966
I'm still
trying to access...

1623
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,451
Don't tell me you're
involved in this, too?

1624
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,320
Well, Trevor roped me into going
through their zero-day exploit codes.

1625
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,641
This thing is
a mess, man.

1626
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,448
Why did I agree to this?
Good luck.

1627
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,881
This is Patrick...

1628
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:16,364
What you're gonna
do is you're gonna...

1629
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,564
I told him, I...
Help them.

1630
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,451
Get back to work, guys.

1631
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,521
No, Patrick, show me.

1632
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,925
Talk about
getting hung out to dry.

1633
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,729
Yeah. Are we set?

1634
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,771
Trouble with the Navy?

1635
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,527
One of those idiots ripped
some bullshit piece of Israeli code

1636
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,728
and jammed it down our payload.
Can you believe that?

1637
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,081
Script kiddies.

1638
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,571
I know, I know. I
should have listened to you.

1639
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,005
Is this it?

1640
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,366
Here.
Yeah, this is it.

1641
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,011
I'm gonna make the goddamn
Israelis take the fall for this.

1642
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,961
Come on.

1643
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,929
Got it? I'm not taking
the fall for this.

1644
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,681
Patrick.

1645
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,804
Still working on it,
Trev. Hold on.

1646
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,121
Still nothing.

1647
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,721
Yeah, but...

1648
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,728
You headed
home already?

1649
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,088
Yeah. I'm not
feeling so well.

1650
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:26,162
Might not be in
tomorrow either.

1651
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,450
You know,
Trevor's kind of busy,

1652
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,965
maybe you could
let him know for me?

1653
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,122
It'd be my pleasure.

1654
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,766
If you're really not feeling well,
dude, maybe you should...

1655
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,089
go back to the States
and see your doctor.

1656
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,323
I think that, you know,
folks would understand that.

1657
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,844
That sounds like
a smart thing.

1658
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,411
Take care of yourself.

1659
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,326
Yeah, you too, bro.

1660
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,444
You ever play
with one of these?

1661
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,166
Yeah, when I was a kid.

1662
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,607
Yeah. You should try it.
It's hard.

1663
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,451
I can't figure this out.

1664
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,490
I don't know
about this.

1665
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,563
Yeah, you gotta start with
the white cross, actually,

1666
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,210
and then you do
the corners.

1667
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,889
Look, I love these things.

1668
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,291
Have
a good weekend, man.

1669
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,850
You too, buddy.
All right.

1670
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,806
It's live.

1671
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:14,968
There's a link to
the FISA court order.

1672
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,841
Well done, Janine.

1673
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,445
I told you
she wasn't a pushover.

1674
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,727
Well, it feels so
goddamn good to be wrong.

1675
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,641
Breaking news tonight. Reports
that through a secret court order,

1676
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,291
the Obama administration is
collecting the phone records

1677
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,044
of millions of
Verizon customers.

1678
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,327
That's been reported by the
Guardian newspaper in the U.K.

1679
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,686
The specific court order shows

1680
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,889
that all the information is going
to the National Security Agency.

1681
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,048
How's that for
mainstream media, Glenn?

1682
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,805
They can't shut this down now. And
we've got four more days of it.

1683
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,002
They have no idea what
they're in store for.

1684
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,161
That's fantastic!

1685
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,050
Former Speaker of the House
is on the grill tonight and joins me now.

1686
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,487
Another explosive
article has just appeared,

1687
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,005
this time in
The Washington Post.

1688
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:10,162
It's breaking news
that it reveals

1689
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,642
another broad and secret U.S.
government surveillance program.

1690
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:17,327
The Washington Post and the
Guardian in London reporting

1691
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,930
that the NSA and the FBI

1692
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,129
are tapping directly
into the central servers

1693
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,521
of nine leading
Internet companies,

1694
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,206
including Microsoft,
Yahoo, Google, Facebook,

1695
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:30,204
AOL, Skype, YouTube,
and Apple.

1696
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,521
The Post says
they're extracting audio,

1697
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,444
video, photographs,
e-mails, documents,

1698
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,726
and connection logs

1699
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,121
that enable analysts to
track a person's movements

1700
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,441
and contacts over time.

1701
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,327
In the abstract, you can
complain about Big Brother

1702
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,530
and how this is a potential
program run amok.

1703
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,802
But when you actually
look at the details,

1704
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,962
then I think we've struck
the right balance.

1705
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,203
U.S. President
Barack Obama staunchly defends

1706
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,487
U.S. government programs,

1707
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,928
insisting that they were
conducted with broad safeguards

1708
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,287
and to protect against abuse.

1709
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,401
He reached the conclusion
that what was happening

1710
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,881
inside this really
secretive agency

1711
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,247
was very
threatening and menacing

1712
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,721
to privacy rights,
to Internet freedom,

1713
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,610
to basic political liberty,
not only in the United States,

1714
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,728
but all around the world.

1715
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,526
And he felt it was his duty as
a human being to disclose it.

1716
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:42,563
My name's Ed Snowden.
I'm 29 years old.

1717
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,085
I work for
Booz Allen Hamilton

1718
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:47,687
as an infrastructure analyst
for NSA in Hawaii.

1719
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,481
The identity of the man
who sent the Obama...

1720
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,770
You can't come forward against the
most powerful intelligence agencies

1721
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,451
in the world without expecting
to have some risk.

1722
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,602
They're just such
powerful adversaries.

1723
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:12,610
So no one can
meaningfully oppose them.

1724
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,801
He did it.

1725
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,724
You know, if they want to get
you, they will get you, in time.

1726
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,801
The kid did it!

1727
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,769
And it's just gonna get
worse for the next generation,

1728
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,205
as they extend
the capabilities

1729
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,807
of this sort of
architecture of oppression.

1730
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,204
And you realize that you might
be willing to accept any risk,

1731
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:33,041
as long as the public is able
to make their own decision

1732
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:34,764
about how
this is applied.

1733
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,731
Because even if you haven't
done anything wrong,

1734
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,768
you're being
watched and recorded.

1735
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:44,243
Look, I had access to the
entire intelligence community.

1736
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,563
So, if I had wanted
to harm the U.S.,

1737
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,884
you could shut down the entire
surveillance system in an afternoon.

1738
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,248
But that was never
my intention.

1739
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,403
And I think anybody
that's making that argument,

1740
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:02,849
they have to think,
if they were in my position,

1741
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:06,686
living in Hawaii, in paradise,
and making a ton of money,

1742
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:11,641
what would it take to make
you leave everything behind?

1743
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:17,368
The fear that I think I have
most in regards to the outcome

1744
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,205
for America of
these disclosures

1745
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,487
is that nothing
will change.

1746
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,360
In the coming months and the coming
years, it'll just get worse.

1747
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,011
And then eventually,
at some point,

1748
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:33,165
some new leader
will be elected

1749
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:37,131
who flips the switch,

1750
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:44,049
and the people won't be able to do
anything, by that point, to oppose it.

1751
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,082
And it'll be
turnkey tyranny.

1752
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,201
How you holding up?

1753
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:53,282
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1754
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,645
It's you guys that have
to start watching out

1755
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,210
for yourselves now.

1756
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:00,886
You know, if you have
any reason to believe

1757
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,568
that you're about to be raided or
intercepted or breached in any way,

1758
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,202
you format and destroy
all the data immediately.

1759
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:13,250
You have
the encrypted backups.

1760
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,451
And now...

1761
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:21,364
I no longer have any access
to these files myself.

1762
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,090
You guys have them all.

1763
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:29,490
Keep the focus on the stories,
that's all that matters.

1764
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,170
If you'll excuse me, it's...

1765
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,082
I think we should all get some rest.
We can use it.

1766
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,443
Yeah. I should probably
lay down on a soft bed

1767
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,568
while I still have
one available, right?

1768
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,089
You rest well.
Thank you.

1769
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,725
See you tomorrow.
Good night.

1770
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,367
Can you at least tell me
where you're going?

1771
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,810
Listen,
I know that I'm...

1772
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:09,764
Ewen, I'm on
the second floor.

1773
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,611
I don't see Tibbo.

1774
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,247
I think I see him.

1775
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,281
There's press swarming
all over the hotel.

1776
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,044
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

1777
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:26,168
I'll stop them with a press
conference or something.

1778
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:30,205
I'm Glenn. Look, we
really appreciate this.

1779
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:32,328
We understand you're one of the
best lawyers in Hong Kong.

1780
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,487
We'll do our best.

1781
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,530
We're gonna take him to the UN
first, then I prefer not to reveal.

1782
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,567
I understand.

1783
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:39,927
They spotted me.
You guys get going.

1784
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,244
Okay, I will take your questions
in an orderly fashion.

1785
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,401
Where is Snowden?
Do you know where he is?

1786
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,481
Come on,
please let us know!

1787
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,241
Did you get them?

1788
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,924
Yeah, this is the best
I could do.

1789
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,611
You're meeting Tibbo
in five minutes,

1790
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,206
on the skybridge
opposite the large mall.

1791
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:04,204
I've met a lot of astonishing
people in my life, but you...

1792
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,687
Okay, laddie.
Off you go.

1793
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:11,130
I won't let you down.

1794
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,806
You'd make a shitty journalist
without a camera.

1795
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,444
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1796
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,804
Okay. That's a great idea.

1797
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,168
You don't want to
leave your luck behind.

1798
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,849
I think I'd like you
to have that.

1799
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,281
Thanks for everything.

1800
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,051
I have
a van on the street.

1801
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:12,403
NSA leaker Edward
Snowden has now been charged formally

1802
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:17,247
with espionage, theft, and
conversion of government property.

1803
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,124
U.S.
Officials have asked Hong Kong

1804
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:20,725
to detain
the former contractor

1805
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,649
on a provisional
arrest warrant.

1806
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,848
Snowden has been
in Hong Kong since May...

1807
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,129
remember, that
was back reportedly on May 20th.

1808
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:31,331
Snowden has checked
out of the luxury hotel in Hong Kong,

1809
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,640
where he had been holed up.

1810
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,847
You might
turn your eyes away.

1811
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,331
Not likely
take action against him

1812
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,441
without an arrest
warrant from the U. S.

1813
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,171
The Justice Department
had to go to Interpol so that Snowden,

1814
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,447
if he tried to cross a border, he
could be intercepted and detained.

1815
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,931
Snowden is still in hiding.

1816
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,001
So again...

1817
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,764
But the
Americans are now closing in.

1818
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,002
They almost certainly know
where he is,

1819
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,726
they just need Hong Kong's
approval to get him.

1820
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,529
The Hong
Kong government does have

1821
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:57,648
an extradition agreement
with Washington.

1822
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,846
But the ultimate decision...

1823
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,362
So the big
question here is, where is he now?

1824
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,169
Thank you.
This is Ed. Ed, Mayana.

1825
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:09,924
Ed. Welcome.
Thank you.

1826
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,723
These are good people.
They won't talk.

1827
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:18,170
I've been handling their cases for years.
They're like you.

1828
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:19,446
That's so nice.

1829
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,649
They're stateless.

1830
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:25,567
So we're waiting on the UN
application for refugee status.

1831
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:29,684
Just in case you're arrested,
this is where you can call me.

1832
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,121
Good.

1833
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,131
Thank you so much.

1834
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,008
You may not feel it,
Ed, but you're not alone.

1835
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:46,961
Thank you.

1836
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,648
His longtime
girlfriend, Lindsay Mills,

1837
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:52,926
an amateur photographer,

1838
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,411
has not been heard from.

1839
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,403
It's believed
she's in seclusion

1840
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,005
in her parents' home
in Maryland,

1841
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,923
and has been questioned
by the FBI

1842
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,923
and remains
under investigation.

1843
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,606
Ten days have now gone by,
as the world looks for Edward Snowden.

1844
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:11,082
Rumors have surfaced that a rich
supporter is hiding Snowden

1845
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:14,522
somewhere in the Hong Kong
hills in a private mansion.

1846
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,927
It is now
confirmed that Edward Snowden

1847
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,321
has boarded a flight
from Hong Kong to Moscow.

1848
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,289
The State Department
is very disappointed

1849
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,964
in the authorities
in Hong Kong

1850
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,690
for letting Snowden go.

1851
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:59,331
He was accompanied
by a representative from WikiLeaks.

1852
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:02,563
Snowden is trying
to make his way from Russia to Cuba,

1853
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:04,847
and then to Ecuador
for political asylum.

1854
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:07,167
Moscow airport
officials say he won't be permitted

1855
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,651
to make his connective flight

1856
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,166
because the U.S. government
has revoked his passport.

1857
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,971
The United States
Secretary of State, John Kerry,

1858
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:17,931
outraged that Russia is refusing
to arrest the American fugitive.

1859
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,164
Now a man without a country
stranded inside the Moscow airport.

1860
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:24,925
No, I'm not gonna
be scrambling jets,

1861
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,608
to get a 29-year-old hacker.

1862
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,650
The President of Bolivia's plane

1863
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,007
was forced down in
Austria airspace today

1864
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:39,369
following U.S. suspicions that
Snowden may have been on board.

1865
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,807
After 39 days in the airport hotel,

1866
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,326
he's left with his Russian
lawyer and a legal advisor

1867
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,528
from WikiLeaks, Sarah Harrison.

1868
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,210
He can now enjoy
all of the sweet, sweet liberty

1869
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:53,443
allowed under the regime
of President Vladimir Putin.

1870
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,729
There is still
a thing called execution.

1871
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,131
Mr. Snowden
actually deserves asylum

1872
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,486
and protection
around the globe.

1873
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,729
But he does have asylum
in Russia at least.

1874
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,802
He can engage in
the debate he started.

1875
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,726
And the world
now has an example

1876
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,040
that you can do
the right thing,

1877
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:11,886
and you don't have to end up
in a cage, one room, a prison.

1878
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:17,169
After more than a year
in the country under temporary asylum,

1879
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:21,643
Edward Snowden has received a
three-year residency permit in Russia.

1880
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,049
And now,
here live from Moscow,

1881
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,924
Edward Snowden.

1882
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:38,169
Ed. How you doing?

1883
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,005
Thank you.

1884
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:48,007
Forgive me if I get my
bearings a little bit here.

1885
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,560
People always said
I was kind of a robot.

1886
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,566
How is it that
you came to be in Russia?

1887
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,924
Well, I never intended
to come here.

1888
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,925
You know, my passport was revoked
en route to Latin America.

1889
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,651
So when people say,
"Why are you in Russia?"

1890
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,610
I say,
"Ask the State Department."

1891
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:11,047
Does that mean you're willing
to go back and face trial?

1892
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,645
Absolutely, if it was
a fair and public trial.

1893
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:19,045
Unfortunately, that's not
what would happen right now,

1894
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:23,205
as long as the Espionage Act is
being used against whistleblowers.

1895
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,528
Do you still
think it was worth it?

1896
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,647
Yes, I do.

1897
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:31,645
Without the information
to start a public debate,

1898
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,131
we're lost.
You know...

1899
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,281
The people being able
to question our government

1900
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,966
and hold it accountable,

1901
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:44,967
that's the principle that the United
States of America was founded on.

1902
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:48,801
So if we want to protect
our national security,

1903
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,326
we should be protecting
that principle.

1904
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,247
What if your
argument falls on deaf ears?

1905
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,641
What if our leaders
don't act?

1906
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,683
I believe that,
if nothing changes,

1907
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:07,242
more and more people all over
the world will come forward.

1908
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:12,926
Whistleblowers and journalists,
but also regular citizens.

1909
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:19,608
And when those in power try to
hide by classifying everything,

1910
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:23,204
we will call them out on it.

1911
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:29,489
And when they try to scare us into
sacrificing our basic human rights,

1912
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:31,847
we won't be intimidated,

1913
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:36,602
and we won't give up,
and we will not be silenced.

1914
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:40,083
You're alone in
a foreign country,

1915
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:43,403
you'll be extradited
if you try to leave.

1916
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,164
That must be hard.

1917
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:01,241
When I left Hawaii,
I lost everything.

1918
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,848
And I had a stable life.

1919
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:12,008
A stable love.

1920
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,003
Family. Future.

1921
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,643
And I lost that life,

1922
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,648
but I've gained
a new one,

1923
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,963
and I'm incredibly
fortunate.

1924
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:30,731
And I think

1925
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,165
the greatest freedom
that I've gained

1926
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:37,847
is the fact that I no longer have to
worry about what happens tomorrow,

1927
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,321
because I'm happy with
what I've done today.

1928
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,764
Live from the Internet,
Edward Snowden!

1929
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,410
Has your
mindset changed about him?

1930
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:12,565
Is he now more whistleblower
than he is a hacker?

1931
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,928
What is going to happen
to Edward Snowden?

1932
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,731
He's going to die in Moscow.
He's not coming home.

1933
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,007
Edward Snowden,
is he a traitor or a hero?

1934
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:38,363
He stole very important information.

1935
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,291
We have
breaking news tonight...

1936
02:09:58,360 --> 02:09:59,361
Among the reforms,

1937
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:02,125
work with Congress to change how
the NSA collects phone records.

1938
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,766
Mandate more transparency
by the secret court

1939
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,922
that regularly approves
the surveillance.

1940
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,808
Well, is it
a victory for Edward Snowden?

1941
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,723
That's gonna depend
on the eye of the beholder.

1942
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,887
The American government
was acting illegally.

1943
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:20,884
I don't think he should be brought
home without facing the music.

1944
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,769
Snowden played a very important role

1945
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,002
in educating the American people

1946
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:31,483
to the degree in which our civil
liberties and our constitutional rights

1947
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:32,721
are being undermined.
